# wedlock

A personal project I created and published on play store to invite my friends and family for my wedding. I developed this application in a span of 2 months as a side project. I designed it in such a way that same application can be resued and personalized for creating many e-invites by adding new data and different login for each e-invite.

I designed the UI and implemented many features such as 
- Personalised login and password for each invitation 
- Login through SSO using Google and Facebook accounts to track users who are viewing the invitations and to protect personal information
- A custom description for each invitation and a countdown timer to wedding date
- An events page with tab support for each event. Each event supports a time and Google map location with ability to get directions to location
- A Image gallery page where the couples can upload pictures and the images are cached locally and protected for better performance. Image gallery also supports carousal view

Currently the app is removed from play store since I did not get time to udpdate the app to latest Android versions
